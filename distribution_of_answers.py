twenty people are answer is agree or disagree...


answers:

- if every person is twice as likely to select agree than to select disagree, the distribution will be a binomial distribution

- if every person is equally likely to select agree or disagree, then as the number of people who answer 
the question increases, the distribution will increasingly resemble a normal distribution

- If only one person answer the question, the distribution will be a bernoulli distribution
